# 🕵️ Responsible AI Inspector – Assignment  

Hi there! I’m your friendly **AI detective**, and today I had two cases on my desk. Both looked normal on the outside, but when I dug deeper… the AI wasn’t playing fair. Let me take you through my investigation.

## 🕵️ Case 1: The Suspicious Hiring Bot  

### 🔍 What’s happening  
A company decided to speed things up by using an **AI bot to screen job applications**. On the surface, it’s efficient: fewer resumes for humans to read, faster hiring decisions.  

### ⚠️ What’s problematic  
Here’s the twist — the AI **keeps rejecting more women who have career gaps** (like those who took time off for childcare). Why? Because the AI was trained on old company data where women with breaks in their careers were often overlooked.  

In short:  
- It copied past **bias** and turned it into a system-wide “rule.”  
- Applicants get rejected without knowing **why** (no transparency).  
- The company can shrug and say “the AI did it” (no accountability).  

### 💡 Detective’s Fix  
- **Audit the data**: check if the AI is treating men and women equally.  
- Add a **human reviewer** before making final rejection decisions.  
- Be open with candidates about how the AI screens them.

## 🕵️ Case 2: The Overzealous School Proctor  

### 🔍 What’s happening  
A school uses an **AI exam proctor** that watches students through their webcams. If you look away too long or your eyes move too much, the system flags you as “suspicious.”  

### ⚠️ What’s problematic  
Sounds strict, right? But here’s the problem: students who are **neurodivergent** or have disabilities often move differently. They get flagged for “cheating” when they’re actually just being themselves.  

That means:  
- Innocent students face unfair treatment (**bias**).  
- Everyone feels watched 24/7 (**privacy invasion**).  
- False alarms make teachers and students **lose trust** in the system.  

### 💡 Detective’s Fix  
- Don’t rely only on eye-tracking. Use **multiple signals** (like unusual typing patterns, background noise, etc.).  
- Let students **appeal AI flags** so a teacher makes the final call.  
- Involve **diverse students** when building the system, so it doesn’t exclude anyone.

## 📝 Case Closed  

Both cases taught me the same lesson:  
AI isn’t evil, but if we’re careless, it can **repeat human mistakes at scale**.  

- The **Hiring Bot** unfairly punished women because it learned from biased history.  
- The **Proctoring AI** accused innocent students because it relied on shallow rules.  

✅ The fix is simple but powerful: **audit the systems, keep humans involved, and be transparent**.  

Until then, I’ll keep my magnifying glass handy. 🕵️✨
